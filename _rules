meter is decided by the length between the start codon and stop codon

rhythms are by the structure of nucleotides
at(u)gc
a: dd- / d-d / -dd
t: d-d-
g: dd-d/ d-dd
c: d---

pitch difference is by the acidity of nucleotides
a: 4.15   3 2.85             3  -1
t: 9.7    2 -2.7             4  +3
g: 3.3    4 3.7              1  -2
c: (default), 4.45    2 2.55 2   0

tonic depends on start codon
M(ATG):C
V(GTG):Eb
L(TTG):Gb
other: A



flexibility: lfo fm, ramp

secondary: H: attack길게, ramp되게
        e:
        L: 

reliability: amplitude
그루브: 2,3으로 나눠서 만들기
